============================

The ruby code calls a java class to generate the powerpoint file using the Apache POI library.
These 2 classes send and receive messages from each other, so they are highly coupled.

* app/models/concerns/power_point.rb
* java/src/Powerpoint.java

============================
Developer setup for running the Java powerpoint generator.

Download and install a Java JDK
(I'm using version "1.8.0_20")

Download and install ant:
http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

Compile the java source:

```bash
cd java
ant
cd ..
```

Make your java.yml file
```bash
cp config/java.yml.sample config/java.yml
# you'll need to restart after this
```

To make a powerpoint file:
Browse to the show page for a collection and click the link to download a powerpoint.

============================
TODO:

* When the code is finalized, get rid of this file, and put all the relevant info into the project README.

* Get these steps into the deploy script
